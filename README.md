# Telco Customer Churn
Examining the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset and using machine learning to predict customer churn based on the features provided.

### Dataset
[Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)


### Overview
This project uses Kaggle's "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, which provides customer information for a telecommunications company offering phone and internet services. The purpose of this project is to use this information to predict customer churn within the company and gain actionable insights to reduce future customer loss.

### Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)


### Results
The **Logistic Regression** model performed the best at predicting customer churn. The features affecting the model's decisions the most were **tenure (length of time with the company), contract type, add-ons (specifically phone service), and total charges**. Retention strategies should focus on incentivizing longer contracts, bundling add-ons, and providing relief for high-charge customers, perhaps through discounts.

### Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly Express
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
